# AP Lab: Statistics
## Problem
In AP Statistics, you will be shown a program consisting of manipulated and random numbers. Similarly to AP 3D Design, only a compiled .class file will be given rather than Java code.

Note: In the program given, "guess" will need to be in flag format, flag{...}, for the program to accept "guess" as the flag.

[APStatistics.java (decompiled)](APStatistics.java)
